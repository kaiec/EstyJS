# EstyJS 2.0

This is the new official home of EstyJS, since I took over the further maintenance from [Darren Coles](https://github.com/dmcoles/EstyJs/) in 2024, marked by the release of EstyJS 2.0 on November 13th.

EstyJS 2.0 runs here: [https://kaiec.github.io/EstyJS/](https://kaiec.github.io/EstyJS/)

## Changes from 1.0
- Fully working mouse pointer synchronisation.
- Fullscreen mode.
- All lines of the display are rendered, instead of only every other line to create a scan line effect. The scan line effect can still be activated if desired.
- EmuTOS 1.3 192k is used as ROM, so that EstyJS is fully open source and does not use any proprietary software.
- Design of the new logo.
- Redesign of the default website.
